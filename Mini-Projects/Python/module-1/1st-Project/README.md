## Project Description
The Hangman game is a game where a player tries to guess the secret random word in a certain number of attempts, otherwise, he loses the game. I chose this game because I wanted to learn how it can be coded and check the possibilities of the game's code.

## Rules
The player has to enter a letter and then the program validates the input entered. This means that the input has to be a letter from the alphabet, not a special character, and not a number. Also, the player has six attempts until he correctly guesses the secret word.     

## Workflow
At the beginning, I created a drawing with several procedures of my program. Then I created the basic structure of my code and next, I started implementing the different ideas and debugging any errors that occurred until the final result.

## Organization
The name of my repository is data-labs-projects. Insite my repository I have a README.md file and a folder with the name Mini-Projects/Python.
Inside this file, I created three folders that correspond to the three modules that the cohort is divided. Then, inside the module-1 folder, there is another folder with the name 1st-Project which is saved the current project.
I did not use the Trello yet, but I will add to my project.
