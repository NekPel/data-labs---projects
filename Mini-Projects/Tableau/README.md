# Project: UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE winners through the years with Tableau
*[Nektarios]*

*[Data Analytics, Berlin & 06.20]*


## Project Description
- My project is to present information about one of the most famous European football events called the UEFA Champions League. In this competition, are participating top football clubs across the continent, making it one of the most-watched events of the year.
It began in 1955/56.


## Data
- I got my data from "data.world". Although they were cleaned,  I added a new column "Year" (from 1956 to 2019), so I can use this value and not the "Season" as a time series.    
There is the "Winner" and the  "Finalist" of the final match. Also, there is the "Country" from which each team comes,  the scorers, the goals from each team, the venue that took place, and finally, the number of people who attended the match. 


## Obstacles  
- Mainly I had two problems that I couldn't find a solution to.
First, due to the fact that the data start in 1956, some countries are not on the map chart in Tableau, such as "Western Germany", "Yugoslavia". Also,  I have edited the location for England and Scotland on the map chart to present the number of wins in each country, because the map chart highlights only the UK.
Second, I couldn't figure out how I could find the top scorer of all time.
